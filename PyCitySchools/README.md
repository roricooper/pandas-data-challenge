Observations of the Py City School Data

Part X - Three observable trends based on the data:

1.	Overall passing rates begin to decline when the budget per student rises above 615. This is a surprising observation because one would assume that more funding per student would mean better performance but this data shows the opposite. All district schools fall into the large size category and spend over 615 per student. This could mean the district is spending more funding on the cost to operate large school buildings (staff, facilities/utilities, cafeteria, etc.) and less on student/teacher classroom resources.

2.	Overall passing rates begin to decline when the school size exceeds 2K. This observation could indicate that the larger buildings and class sizes negatively impact student performance because less money is spent on student programs/resources and fewer teachers are available for each student (teacher-to-student ratio).

3.	Overall passing rates of Charter schools perform over 20% higher than District schools. Upon a closer inspection of the data one can observe that all District schools are specifically struggling with math (all district schools <78 in math).
As a next step I would like to obtain more data to expand on each of these observations. It would be interesting to see the total number of teachers per school to calculate the teacher-to-student ratios and determine if larger classes are the root cause of lower math scores at district schools. It would also be interesting to see the funding allocations at each school, i.e. the school budgets for teacher/admin/staff payroll, classroom technology, books, after school programs, athletics, facility maintenance, and so on. Charter schools could be succeeding overall because they do not have the operational costs to run large buildings and can focus more of their funding on employing more teachers per student, student programs, and technology. As the district's data scientist, I would want to show where costs are draining and try to influence decision makers to direct more funding towards math department programs/resources and suggest some administrative changes such as, hiring more math teachers to decrease the classroom size and paying teachers overtime to provide after-school tutoring.
